I built a portfolio website for myself with Django. The frontend is based on CSS styling from a project called Mumble (developed by Shahriar P. Shuvo) and the backend I built with Django and connected it to a SQL lite database. By querying a different profile from the database and accessing a Django model called users, anyone can create the exact similar page with their own attributes. And by changing the projects under the project model one can showcase their own work.
Take a look at the page from the Project Url below.
